# hydrogel-alcohol-sensors

  Raw data for characterization of PHEMA hydrogel sensors and alcohol sensing measurements
  
  Spectra recorded by a USB 4000 spectrometer to characterize the dispersion ability of printed 1D and 2D PHEMA gratings; 
  Spectra recorded by  a USB 4000 spectrometer to monitor and analyze the response process under different conditions, including 1D grating sensor to different alcohols, 2D grating sensors with different crosslinking densities of hydrogels to different alcohols;
  Optical powers of zero and first diffraction orders for PHEMA gratings under different coditions.
